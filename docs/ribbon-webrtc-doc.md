## create

The SDK creation factory. Create an instance of the SDK by calling this factory with the desired configurations.
The SDK instance will be referred as 'api' throughout the rest of the documentation content.

### Parameters

*   `config` **[config][1]** The configuration object.

### Examples

```javascript
// Instantiate the SDK.
import { create } from '@rbbn/webrtc-js-sdk'
const client = create({
    authentication: { ... },
    logs: { ... },
    ...
});
// Use the SDK's API.
client.on( ... );
```

Returns **[api][2]** The SDK instance.

## config

The configuration object. This object defines what different configuration
values you can use when instantiating the SDK using the [create][3] function.

### config.logs

Configuration options for the Logs feature.

The SDK will log information about the operations it is performing. The
amount of information will depend on how the Logs feature is configured.

The format of logs can also be customized by providing a
[LogHandler][4]. This function will receive a
[LogEntry][5] which it can handle as it sees fit. By
default, the SDK will log information to the console. For more
information, see the [Logs feature][6] description.

#### Parameters

*   `logs` **[Object][7]** Logs configs.

    *   `logs.logLevel` **[string][8]** Log level to be set. See [logger.levels][9]. (optional, default `'debug'`)
    *   `logs.handler` **[logger.LogHandler][10]?** The function to receive log entries from the
        SDK. If not provided, a default handler will be used that logs entries
        to the console.
    *   `logs.logActions` **([Object][7] | [boolean][11])** Options specifically for action logs when
        logLevel is at DEBUG+ levels. Set this to false to not output action logs. (optional, default `false`)

        *   `logs.logActions.handler` **[logger.LogHandler][10]?** The function to receive action
            log entries from the SDK. If not provided, a default handler will be used
            that logs actions to the console.
        *   `logs.logActions.actionOnly` **[boolean][11]** Only output information
            about the action itself. Omits the SDK context for when it occurred. (optional, default `false`)
        *   `logs.logActions.collapsed` **[boolean][11]** Whether logs should be
            minimized when initially output. The full log is still output and can be
            inspected on the console. (optional, default `false`)
        *   `logs.logActions.diff` **[boolean][11]** Include a diff of what SDK
            context was changed by the action. (optional, default `false`)
        *   `logs.logActions.level` **[string][8]** Log level to be set
            on the action logs (optional, default `'debug'`)

information.

The progress of the operation will be tracked via the
[call:operation][20] event.

The SDK will emit a [call:stateChange][24]
event locally when the operation completes. The remote participant
will be notified, through their own
[call:stateChange][24] event, that the
call was ended.

### Parameters

*   `callId` **[string][8]** The ID of the call to end.

## call:availableCodecs

The list of available and supported codecs by the browser have been retrieved.

       ...
   })
})
```

## call:mediaConnectionChange

A Call's media connection state has been changed.

This event is emitted as a result of changes to the media connection of the Call.
These state changes occur during call establishment, connection loss/re-establishment, call completion, etc.

To check the media connection state of a call, retrieve the call's information using the  [call.getById][26] API,

   if (params.error) {
     // The operation failed. May want to determine whether to re-attempt the
     //    operation (if the failure was simply a connectivity issue) or to
     //    consider the call's media irrecoverable.
     ...
   } else {
     // The call should be re-establishing media, with the call's
     //    `mediaConnectionState` being updated.
     const mediaState = client.call.getById(params.callId).mediaConnectionState

## call:operation

A call operation has either started, been updated, or finished.

Information about ongoing call operations are stored on the
[CallObject][31]. This event indicates that an operation's
information has changed.

The status of an operation indicates whether the local or remote side of the
call is currently processing it, with values being 'ONGOING' or 'PENDING',
respectively. All operations will begin as 'ONGOING' status with an event
indicating the 'START' transition. Operations that require a response from
the remote side will have an 'UPDATE' transition to the 'PENDING' status once
it starts to wait for the response. Once complete, an event will indicate
a 'FINISH' transition and the operation will be removed from the call state.

### Parameters

*   `params` **[Object][7]** 

    *   `params.callId` **[string][8]** The ID for the call being operated on.
    *   `params.operation` **[string][8]** The type of operation causing this event.

### Examples

```javascript
client.on('call:operation', (params) => {
   const { callId, operationId } = params

   // Get the operation from the call's state that this event is about.
   const call = client.call.getById(callId)
   const operation = call.currentOperations.find(op => op.id === operationId)
   log(`${operation.type} operation is now ${operation.status} for call ${callId}.`)
})
```

## call:receive

A new incoming call has been received.

Information about the Call can be retrieved using the [call.getById][26]
API.

NOTE: Upon receiving this notification the call is in "Initiating" state. In order
to answer calls, they must be in either "Ringing" or "Initiated" states. Therefore,
this event should not be used to prompt the user to respond. Instead, the
[call:stateChange][32] event should be used for this purpose.

   }
})
```

## call:trackReplaced

A local Track has been replaced by the [call.replaceTrack][36] API.

This event is a combination of a track being removed from the Call and a new
track being added to the Call. The previous Track's media is no longer
available, similar to the [call:tracksRemoved][37]
event, and the new Track is available in its place, similar to the
[call:tracksAdded][38] event. The event
includes information about the Track that was replaced to help an application
replace it seamlessly.

### Parameters

*   `params` **[Object][7]** 

    *   `params.callId` **[string][8]** The ID of the call where a track was replaced.
    *   `params.newTrackId` **[string][8]?** The ID of the new track that replaced the old track.
    *   `params.oldTrack` **call.TrackObject?** State of the replaced track.
    *   `params.error` **[api.BasicError][30]?** An error object, if the operation was not successful.

### Examples

```javascript
client.on('call:trackReplaced', function (params) {
  const { callId, oldTrack, newTrackId } = params

  // Unrender the removed track.
  handleTrackGone(oldTrack, callId)

  // Render the added track.
  const track = client.media.getTrackById(newTrackId)
  handleTrackAdded(track, callId)
})
```

## call:tracksAdded

Tracks have been added to the Call after an SDK operation. Both sides of the Call
are now able to render these tracks.

Tracks are added to a Call when either the local or remote user adds new media
to the Call, using the [call.addMedia][39] API for example, or when the
Call is unheld with the [call.unhold][40] API.

Remote tracks are similarly added to a Call when new tracks are added by the
remote user or either user unholds the call.

This event can indicate that multiple tracks have been removed by the same
operation. For example, if the remote user added video to the call, this
event would indicate a single, remote video track was added. If the local
user unheld the call, this event would indicate that any tracks previously
on the call have been re-added, both local and remote.

Information about a Track can be retrieved using the [media.getTrackById][41] API.

### Parameters

*   `params` **[Object][7]** 

    *   `params.callId` **[string][8]** The ID of the Call the tracks were added to.
    *   `params.trackIds` **[Array][19]<[string][8]>** List of track IDs that have been added to the Call.

### Examples

```javascript
client.on('call:tracksAdded', function (params) {
   // Get the information for each track.
   const tracks = params.trackIds.map(client.media.getTrackById)
   tracks.forEach(track => {
     const { id, kind, isLocal } = track
     // Handle the track depending whether it is audio vs. video and local vs. remote.
     ...
   })
})
```

## call:tracksRemoved

Tracks have been removed from the Call after an SDK operation. The tracks may still
exist, but the media is not available to both sides of the Call any longer.

Tracks are removed from a Call when either the local or remote user stops the
tracks, by using the [call.removeMedia][42] API for example, or when the
Call is held with the [call.hold][43] API.

This event can indicate that multiple tracks have been removed by the same
operation. For example, if the remote user removed video from the call, this
event would indicate a single, remote video track was removed. If the local
user held the call, this event would indicate that all tracks on the call
have been removed, both local and remote.

Information about a Track can be retrieved using the [media.getTrackById][41] API.

### Parameters

*   `params` **[Object][7]** 

    *   `params.callId` **[string][8]** The ID of the Call the tracks were removed from.
    *   `params.trackIds` **[Array][19]<[string][8]>** List of track IDs that have been removed from the Call.

### Examples

```javascript
client.on('call:tracksRemoved', function (params) {
   // Get the information for each track.
   const tracks = params.trackIds.map(client.media.getTrackById)
   tracks.forEach(track => {
     const { id, kind, isLocal } = track
     // Handle the track depending whether it is audio vs. video and local vs. remote.
     ...
   })
})
```

## getAll

Retrieves the information of all calls made during the current session.

### Examples

```javascript
let calls = client.call.getAll()
let currentCalls = calls.filter(call => {
    return call.state === client.call.states.CONNECTED
})
```

Returns **[Array][19]\<call.CallObject>** Call objects.

## getAvailableCodecs

Retrieve the list of available and supported codecs based on the browser's capabilities for sending media.

This API will return a promise which, when resolved, it will contain the list of available and supported codecs.
In addition, the SDK emits a [call:availableCodecs][44] event
upon retrieving that list of codecs.

This API is a wrapper for the static method [RTCRtpSender.getCapabilities()][45].

### Parameters

*   `kind` **[string][8]** The kind of media, i.e., 'audio' or 'video', to get the list of available codecs of.

### Examples

```javascript
try {
   // The API will return a promise that resolves with the codecs.
   const result = await client.call.getAvailableCodecs('audio')
   result.forEach(codec => {
       // Inspect the codec supported by browser by looking at its properties.
       ...
   })
} catch (err) {
   // Handle the error.
   const { code, message } = err
   ...
}
```

Returns **[Promise][46]** A promise that will resolve with an object containing the available codecs, along with the `kind` parameter, that was supplied in the first place.
If there was an error, it will return undefined.

## getById

Retrieves the information of a single call with a specific call ID.

### Parameters

*   `callId` **[string][8]** The ID of the call to retrieve.

Returns **call.CallObject** A call object.

## getReport

Retrieve the call metrics report for a call.

The object returned from this API will be in JSON format. The top level object is the report and will include
a timeline of events that were recorded during a call as well as a map object containing computed metrics.

Any event in a timeline will have it's own timeline that may have recorded events. Events in a timeline are scoped
to that timelines event or report.

The report and some events may have additional data included in a data property.

See event documentation [here][47].
See metrics documentation [here][48].

### Parameters

*   `callId` **[string][8]** The id of the call to retrieve the report on.

Returns **[Object][7]** An object containing all metrics and data tracked against this call.

## getStats

Retrieve a snapshot of the low-level information of the Call through statistical
report.

The data retrieved is a [RTCStatsReport][49]
object, which contains many individual
[RTCStats][50].
These are advanced statistics gathered by the browser providing insights
into the Call at a certain point in time. Aggregating reports over a
period of time would allow a low-level analysis of the Call for that
period. As an example, this could be done to determine the media quality
during the Call.

A Track ID can optionally be provided to get a report for a specific local
Track of the Call.

This API will return a promise which, when resolved, will contain the report of the particular call.
The progress of the operation will be tracked via the
[call:operation][20] event.

The SDK will emit a
[call:statsReceived][51] event, after
the operation completes, that has the report.

### Parameters

*   `callId` **[string][8]** The ID of the Call to retrieve the report.
*   `trackId` **[string][8]?** ID of a local Track being used by the Call. If not
    provided, RTCStatsReport is generated for the Call itself.

### Examples

```javascript
// Get a snapshot of the Call's stats.
//   This may be done on a regular interval to collect data over time.
try {
   // The API will return a promise that resolves with the stats.
   const result = await client.call.getStats(callId)
   result.forEach(stats => {
       // Handle the data on its own or collate with previously gathered stats
       //    for analysis.
       ...
   })
} catch (err) {
   // Handle the error.
   const { code, message } = err
   ...
}
```

Returns **[Promise][46]** A promise that will resolve with the stats report or an error if it fails.

## hold

Puts a call on hold.

The specified call to hold must not already be locally held. Any/all
media received from the remote participant will stop being received,
and any/all media being sent to the remote participant will stop
being sent.

Some call operations cannot be performed while the call is on hold. The
call can be taken off hold with the [call.unhold][40] API.

The progress of the operation will be tracked via the
[call:operation][20] event.

The SDK will emit a [call:stateChange][24]
event locally when the operation completes. The remote participant
will be notified of the operation through a
[call:stateChange][24] event as well.

### Parameters

*   `callId` **[string][8]** The ID of the call to hold.

## mediaConnectionStates

Possible states that a Call's media connection can be in.

A Call's media connection state describes the current status of media within the call.
An application should use this state to understand whether the Call participants are
able to see/hear each other or may be experiencing connection issues. The media connection
state can be used alongside the [Call state][33] to determine if media issues
are occurring while the participants are expecting to be connected.

An important state to check for is the `FAILED` state. This state signifies that there is no
media connection between the call participants and an action must be taken to resolve the
problem. Using the [call.restartMedia][28] API will attempt to reconnect the media. See
the [call.restartMedia][28] API description for more information.

These states are direct reflections of the possible
[RTCPeerConnection.iceConnectionState][52] values.

The Call's media connection state is a property of the [CallObject][31],
which can be retrieved using the [call.getById][26] or
[call.getAll][53] APIs.

The SDK emits a [call:mediaConnectionChange][29]
event when a Call's media connection state changes from one state to another.

Type: [Object][7]

### Properties

*   `NEW` **[string][8]** The Call is initializing the local side of the connection and waiting on information from the remote side.
    When the information is received, the state will transition into `checking` as the Call automatically begins the connection process.
*   `CHECKING` **[string][8]** The Call has received information from the remote endpoint and is working to establish the media connection.
    When finished, the state will transition to either `connected` or `failed`.
*   `CONNECTED` **[string][8]** A usable connection has been made and the Call will now have media.
    The connection may not be optimal, though, so the Call will continue establishment to improve the connection before going into the `completed` state.
*   `COMPLETED` **[string][8]** The media connection process has fully completed and the optimal connection has been established. While in this state,
    the Call endpoints will receive each other's media.
*   `DISCONNECTED` **[string][8]** Media has become disconnected and the Call endpoints have stopped receiving each other's media.
    The Call will automatically attempt to reconnect, transitioning back to `completed` if successful or to `failed` if not.
*   `FAILED` **[string][8]** The connection has failed and cannot be recovered automatically. A full media connection refresh is required to reestablish a connection. See the [call.restartMedia][28] API.
*   `CLOSED` **[string][8]** The connection has been shut down and is no longer in use.

### Examples

```javascript
// Use the media connection states to check the status of the media connection of the Call.
client.on('call:mediaConnectionChange', function (params) {
  // Retrieve the state of the Call this event is for.
  const call = client.call.getById(params.callId)
  const mediaConnectionStates = client.call.mediaConnectionStates

  // Check the mediaConnectionState to determine which scenario the call is in.
  switch (call.mediaConnectionState) {
    case mediaConnectionStates.CONNECTED:
    case mediaConnectionStates.COMPLETED:
      // Media established: The Call's media is connected. The Call's participants
      //    are able to see/hear each other.
      // These states will occur after Call establishment.
      ...
      break
    case mediaConnectionStates.NEW:
    case mediaConnectionStates.CHECKING:
    case mediaConnectionStates.DISCONNECTED:
      // Media pending: The Call's media is not connected. The Call is working
      //    to connect media automatically.
      // These states will occur during Call establishment and may occur midcall if there are
      //    connection issues (eg. poor network quality) or a Call participant has changed (eg. transfer).
      ...
      break
    case mediaConnectionStates.FAILED:
     // Media has failed. The call requires a media refresh to reestablish.
     // This state will occur after the `DISCONNECTED` state is encountered.
     ...
      break
    case mediaConnectionStates.CLOSED:
      // Media ended due to the Call being ended.
      // This state will occur after Call establishment.
      ...
      break
  }
}
```

## metrics

List of metrics available as part of a Call Report.
Metrics are calculated only for the successful scenarios.

As a call progresses, timings are calculated for the duration of operations and
other events. They are recorded in a call report that can be retrieved via
the [call.getReport][54] API.

log(`Call duration was ${callDuration.data}ms.`)
```

## playAudioFile

Plays an audio file to the remote side of the Call. This API will temporarily
replace the Call's local audio track with an audio file for the duration
of the audio file.

The Call must be in `Connected` state and have a local audio track for this operation.

This API will not affect media other than the local audio track. Other media on
the Call, such as local video or remote audio, can be [muted][55]
or [unrendered][56] during this operation if desired.

This operation will use the browser's
[Audio constructor][57]
to read in the audio file. The `filePath` parameter will be used directly with `Audio`, so
can be either a relative file path to your audio file or a URL pointing to a file.

This API returns a promise that can be used to track the progress of the operation.
The promise will resolve after the operation completes or reject if an error is
encountered. Additionally, an extra `onPlaying` callback is provided on the Promise
to indicate when the audio file actually begins to play. See the code example below
for a sample.

The SDK will emit [call:operation][20] events locally
as the operation progresses. The remote endpoint will not receive an event for
this operation.

If an error is encountered during the operation and the SDK is unable to replace
the original local audio track, then that track will be forcibly ended and an
[media:trackEnded][58] event will be emitted
for it. This will release the microphone and avoid losing access to the track
while it is active, allowing the application to resolve the scenario by using
the [call.replaceTrack][36] API to revert the local audio track.

### Parameters

*   `callId` **[string][8]** The ID of the Call to act on.
*   `filePath` **[string][8]** The path to the audio file.

### Examples

```javascript
// The API returns a promise which will provide feedback about the operation.
client.call.playAudioFile(callId, filePath)
   .then(() => {
     // Audio file has finished playing; call has reverted to previous audio.
   })
   .catch(err => {
     // An error has occurred during the operation.
   })

// The returned promise can optionally provide feedback midway through the
//   operation. A chainable `onPlaying` method denotes when the audio file has
//   started to play and the Call's audio has been replaced.
client.call.playAudioFile(callId, filePath)
   .onPlaying(({ duration }) => {
     // Audio file has started playing; call audio is now the file.
     // Note: Calling `onPlaying` must be done before `then` and `catch` for it
     //    to be chainable.
   })
   .then(() => { ... })
   .catch(err => { ... })
```

Returns **[Promise][46]** Promise that resolves when the operation is complete.

## removeMedia

Remove tracks from an ongoing call.

The progress of the operation will be tracked via the
[call:operation][20] event.

The SDK will emit a [call:trackEnded][23]
event for both the local and remote users to indicate that a track
has been removed.

### Parameters

*   `callId` **[string][8]** The ID of the call to remove media from.
*   `tracks` **[Array][19]** A list of track IDs to remove.
*   `options` **[Object][7]?**  (optional, default `{}`)

    *   `options.bandwidth` **call.BandwidthControls?** Options for configuring media's bandwidth.

## replaceTrack

Replace a call's track with a new track of the same media type.

The operation will remove the old track from the call and add a
new track to the call. This effectively allows for changing the
track constraints (eg. device used) for an ongoing call.

Because it completely replaces an old track with a new one,
the old track's state characteristics are not carried over in the new track's state.
(e.g. if an old track's state was 'muted' and replacement of this track has occured,
the new track's state will be 'unmuted', as this is its default state)

The progress of the operation will be tracked via the
[call:operation][20] event.

The SDK will emit a
[call:trackReplaced][59] event
locally when the operation completes. The newly added track will need
to be handled by the local application. The track will be replaced
seamlessly for the remote application, which will not receive an event.

### Parameters

*   `callId` **[string][8]** The ID of the call to replace the track of.
*   `trackId` **[string][8]** The ID of the track to replace.
*   `media` **[Object][7]** The media options. (optional, default `{}`)

    *   `media.audio` **[boolean][11]** Whether to create an audio track. (optional, default `false`)
    *   `media.audioOptions` **call.AudioOptions?** Options for configuring the audio track.
    *   `media.video` **[boolean][11]** Whether to create a video track. (optional, default `false`)
    *   `media.videoOptions` **call.VideoOptions?** Options for configuring the video track.
    *   `media.screen` **[boolean][11]** Whether to create a screen share track. (optional, default `false`)
    *   `media.screenOptions` **call.ScreenOptions?** Options for configuring the call's screenShare.
    *   `media.medias` **[Array][19]<[media.DetachedMedia][22]>?** The detached media containing the track to be attached to this
        call. Though this parameter is an array for consistency with other APIs, it should only contain one entry.

### Examples

```javascript
const callId = ...
// Get the video track used by the call.
const videoTrack = ...

// Replace the specified video track of the call with a new
//    video track.
client.call.replaceTrack(callId, videoTrack.id, {
  // The track should be replaced with a video track using
  //    a specific device. This effectively changes the input
  //    device for an ongoing call.
  video: true,
  videoOptions: {
    deviceId: cameraId
  }
})
```

```javascript
const callId = ...
// Get the video track used by the call.
const videoTrack = ...

// Can also replace the specified video track of the call with a new
// screen sharing track because screen sharing is delivered as a video stream to remote peer.
// User will then be prompted to pick a specific screen to share and thus the device id will be selected.
client.call.replaceTrack(callId, videoTrack.id, {
  // The track should be replaced with a screen sharing track.
  // Note that 'screenOptions' property is not mandatory, as API will use default values
  // for properties like: width, height, frameRate.
  screen: true
})
```

## reportEvents

Events used in the SDK's call reports.

As a call progresses, the operation(s)/function(s) being performed throughout
the duration of a call are recorded as events in a call report.
The call report can be retrieved via the [call.getReport][54] API.
An application can use these event names to find the associated event(s)
in the call report for more information on the event.
See *Call Reports* tutorial for more information on call reports and events.

log(`Took ${getAvailableCodecsEvent.end - getAvailableCodecsEvent.start}ms to get available codecs.`)
```

## restartMedia

Attempt to re-establish a media connection for a call.

This API will perform a "refresh" operation on the call with the intention
of resolving media issues that may have been encountered. This API is only
necessary after the Call's [mediaConnectionState][27]
has entered the `failed` state, but may be used in other scenarios.

After the operation completes successfully, the Call will be re-establishing
its media connection. By this time, or shortly after, the Call's
[mediaConnectionState][27] should have
transitioned to `checking` (via a
[call:mediaConnectionChange][29]
event) to signify the re-establishment. It will then transition to either
`connected` or `failed` state, similar to during the initial Call establishment.

If this operation fails, then the Call will not attempt the re-establishment
and will remain in the `failed` [mediaConnectionState][27].

Behaviour during the operation may differ slightly based on the browser.
Notably, Firefox will always transition to the `checking`
[mediaConnectionState][27] no matter what
the previous state was. Whereas Chrome will skip the `checking` state,
transitioning directly to either `connected` or `failed`. This has the
implication for Chrome that if the state does not change (for example,
the Call is in the `failed` state before the media restart operation,
and media re-establishment fails), then there will be no
[call:mediaConnectionChange][29]
event emitted. For this reason, Chrome-based applications may need a
short delay after receiving the [call:mediaRestart][60]
event before checking the Call's updated
[mediaConnectionState][27] to ensure the
application is acting on the "latest" state.

The SDK will emit a [call:mediaRestart][60]
event when the operation completes.

The progress of the operation will be tracked via the
[call:operation][20] event.

### Parameters

*   `callId` **[string][8]** The ID of the call to act on.

## sendCustomParameters

Send the custom parameters stored as part of an ongoing call to the Gateway. The server may either consume the
headers or relay them to another endpoint, depending on configuration.

Custom parameters are set on a call using the [call.setCustomParameters][61] API.

A Call's custom parameters are stored on the [CallObject][31], which can be retrieved using
the [call.getById][26] or [call.getAll][53] APIs.

### Parameters

*   `callId` **[string][8]** The ID of the call being acted on.

## sendDTMF

Send DTMF tones to a call's audio.

The provided tone can either be a single DTMF tone (eg. '1') or a
sequence of DTMF tones (eg. '123') which will be played one after the
other.

The specified call must be either in Connected, Ringing, or Early Media
state, otherwise invoking this API will have no effect.

The tones will be sent as out-of-band tones if supported by the call,
otherwise they will be added in-band to the call's audio.

The progress of the operation will be tracked via the
[call:operation][20] event.

### Parameters

*   `callId` **[string][8]** ID of the call being acted on.
*   `tone` **[string][8]** DTMF tone(s) to send. Valid characters are \['0','1','2','3','4','5','6','7','8','9','#','\*' and ','].
*   `duration` **[number][13]** The amount of time, in milliseconds, that each DTMF tone should last. (optional, default `100`)
*   `intertoneGap` **[number][13]** The length of time, in milliseconds, to wait between tones. (optional, default `70`)

## setCustomParameters

Set the [Custom Parameters][62] of a call, to be provided to the remote endpoint.

The provided parameters will be saved as part of the call data, to be used throughout the duration of the call.
All subsequent call operations will include these custom parameters. Therefore, invalid parameters, or
parameters not previously configured on the server, will cause subsequent call operations to fail. See
[Custom Parameters][62] for more information on constraints.

A Call's custom parameters are stored on the [CallObject][31], which can be retrieved using
the [call.getById][26] or [call.getAll][53] APIs.

The [call.sendCustomParameters][63] API can be used to send the custom parameters as a stand-alone REST request,
rather than as part of a call operation.

Custom parameters can be removed from a call's information by setting them as undefined (e.g.,
`call.setCustomParameters(callId)`). Subsequent call operations will then no longer send the custom parameters.

### Parameters

*   `callId` **[string][8]** The ID of the call.
*   `customParameters` **([Array][19]\<call.CustomParameter> | [undefined][64])** The custom parameters to set.

### Examples

```javascript
// Set custom parameters on a call.
client.call.setCustomParameters(callId, [
   {
     name: 'Custom-Header',
     value: 'Custom Value'
   }
])
```

Returns **[undefined][64]** 

## setSdpHandlers

Set [SDP Handler Functions][65] that will be run as part of a pipeline for all future calls.
This will replace any SDP Handlers that were previously set.

SDP handlers can be used to make modifications to the SDP (e.g., removing certain codecs)
before they are processed or sent to the other side.

This is an advanced feature, changing the SDP handlers mid-call may cause
unexpected behaviour in future call operations for that call.

### Parameters

*   `sdpHandlers` **[Array][19]\<call.SdpHandlerFunction>** The list of SDP handler functions to modify SDP.

Returns **[undefined][64]** 

## startVideo

Adds local video to an ongoing Call, to start sending to the remote
participant.

Can only be used in a basic media scenario, where the Call does not
already have video. For more advanced scenarios, the
[call.addMedia][39] API can be used.

The progress of the operation will be tracked via the
[call:operation][20] event.

The SDK will emit a [call:tracksAdded][38]
event both for the local and remote users to indicate a track has been
added to the Call.

### Parameters

*   `callId` **[string][8]** ID of the call being acted on.
*   `videoOptions` **call.VideoOptions?** Options for configuring the call's video.
*   `options` **[Object][7]?** 

    *   `options.bandwidth` **call.BandwidthControls?** Options for configuring media's bandwidth.
    *   `options.dscpControls` **call.DSCPControls?** Options for configuring DSCP markings on the media traffic.

## states

Possible states that a Call can be in.

A Call's state describes the current status of the Call. An application
should use the state to understand how the Call, and any media
associated with the Call, should be handled. Which state the Call is
in defines how it can be interacted with, as certain operations can
only be performed while in specific states, and tells an application
whether the Call currently has media flowing between users.
Unless stated otherwise, the Call's state pertains to both caller & callee.

The Call's state is a property of the [CallObject][31],
which can be retrieved using the [call.getById][26] or
[call.getAll][53] APIs.

The SDK emits a [call:stateChange][24]
event when a Call's state changes from one state to another.

Type: [Object][7]

### Properties

*   `INITIATING` **[string][8]** The (outgoing) call is being started. While in this state, no Call operations can be performed until Call gets into Initiated state.
*   `INITIATED` **[string][8]** A call has been started and both the callee and caller may now perform further operations on the call object.
*   `RINGING` **[string][8]** The call has been received by both parties, and is waiting to be answered.
*   `EARLY_MEDIA` **[string][8]** The call has not been answered, but media
    is already being received. This may be network-ringing media, IVR
    system media, or other pre-answer medias. When early media is
    supported, this state may replace the Ringing state. This is a state valid only for caller's side.
*   `CANCELLED` **[string][8]** The call was disconnected before it could be answered. This is a state valid only for callee's side.
*   `CONNECTED` **[string][8]** Both parties are connected and media is flowing.
*   `ON_HOLD` **[string][8]** Both parties are connected but no media is flowing.
*   `ENDED` **[string][8]** The call has ended.

### Examples

```javascript
// Use the call states to know how to handle a change in the call.
client.on('call:stateChange', function (params) {
   const call = client.call.getById(params.callId)
   // Check if the call now has media flowing.
   if (call.state === client.call.states.CONNECTED) {
     // The call is now active, and can perform midcall operations.
   }
})
```

## stopVideo

Removes local video from an ongoing Call, stopping it from being sent
to the remote participant.

Can only be used in a basic media scenario, where the Call has only one
video track. For more advanced scenarios, the
[call.removeMedia][42] API can be used.

The progress of the operation will be tracked via the
[call:operation][20] event.

The SDK will emit a [call:tracksRemoved][37]
event for both the local and remote users to indicate that a track
has been removed.

### Parameters

*   `callId` **[string][8]** ID of the call being acted on.

## unhold

Takes a call off hold.

The specified call to unhold must be locally held. If the call is not
also remotely held, call media will be reconnected as it was before
the call was held.

The progress of the operation will be tracked via the
[call:operation][20] event.

The SDK will emit a [call:stateChange][24]
event locally when the operation completes. The remote participant
will be notified of the operation through a
[call:stateChange][24] event as well.

### Parameters

*   `callId` **[string][8]** The ID of the call to unhold.

## api

The 'api' is the type returned by the create function.
It contains various top-level functions that pertain to SDK global instance
as well as several nested namespaces that pertain to various features (e.g. call, contacts, presence, etc).

### getVersion

Returns the current version of the API.

### destroy

Destroys the SDK, and removes its state, rendering the SDK unusable.
Useful when a user logs out and their call data needs to be destroyed.
The SDK must be recreated to be usable again.
The destroy command is async, and will happen on the next tick
so as not to interfere with any ongoing events.

#### Examples

```javascript
// Instantiate the SDK.
import { create } from '@rbbn/webrtc-js-sdk'
const config = {
    authentication: { ... },
    logs: { ... },
    ...
}
let client = create(config);
client.on( ... )
// Use the SDK
...
// Destroy the SDK, then recreate on the next step
client.destroy()
client = create(config)
client.on( ... )
```

### getConfig

Gets the current configuration Object. This is the object that is initially set as part of SDK creation using 'create' function.

Returns **[Object][7]** A configuration Object.

### updateConfig

Update the configuration values for the SDK to use.

This API will only modify the configurations provided, leaving other configurations
as they were originally set, by performing a merge of the new values into the
previous values.

Please note that the object provided to the `updateConfig` API may be different
than the object retrieved from the [getConfig][66] API. This may happen when a format
change has happened and the SDK modifies the provided format to alleviate
backwards-compatibility issues. We recommend ensuring the configurations you
provide are as described by the [config][67] section.

#### Parameters

*   `newConfigValues` **[Object][7]** Key-value pairs that will be placed into the store. See [config][67] for details on what key-value pairs are available for use.

#### Examples

```javascript
// Instantiate the SDK with certain configs.
const client = create({
  authentication: { ... },
  logs: { ... },
  ...
})

// Modify a subsection of the configs at a later time.
// This will only update the specified configurations.
client.updateConfig({
    logs: {
      loglevel: 'DEBUG'
    }
})
```

### on

Add an event listener for the specified event type. The event is emitted by the SDK instance.

#### Parameters

*   `type` **[string][8]** The event type for which to add the listener.
*   `listener` **[Function][15]** The listener for the event type. The parameters of the listener depend on the event type.

#### Examples

```javascript
// Listen for events of a specific type emitted by the SDK.
client.on('dummy:event', function (params) {
   // Handle the event.
})
```

### off

Removes an event listener for the specified event type. The event is emitted by the SDK instance.

#### Parameters

*   `type` **[string][8]** The event type for which to remote the listener.
*   `listener` **[Function][15]** The listener to remove.

### subscribe

Adds a global event listener to SDK instance.

#### Parameters

*   `listener` **[Function][15]** The event listener to add. The parameters are (type, ...args), where args depend on the event type.

### unsubscribe

Removes a global event listener from SDK instance.

#### Parameters

*   `listener` **[Function][15]** The event listener to remove.

### BasicError

The Basic Error object. Provides information about an error that occurred in the SDK.

Type: [Object][7]

#### Properties

*   `code` **[string][8]** The code of the error. If no code is known, this will be 'NO_CODE'.
*   `message` **[string][8]** A human-readable message to describe the error. If no message is known, this will be 'An error occurred'.

### getBrowserDetails

Retrieve information about the browser being used.

Browser information being defined indicates that the browser supports
basic webRTC scenarios.

#### Examples

```javascript
const details = client.getBrowserDetails()

log(`Browser in use: ${details.browser}, version ${details.version}.`)
```

Returns **[Object][7]** Object containing `browser` and `version` information.

### getUserInfo

Retrieves information about the current user.

Returns **[Object][7]** user The user data.

Returns **[string][8]** user.username The username of the current user. Note that this username can take different encoded forms.
It's not meant to be displayed to a user.

Returns **[string][8]** user.token The current access token.

### request:error

An error occurred with server authorization.

This event will be emitted anytime a REST request to the server is rejected
due to an authorization issue. This may occur for invalid credentials or
expired tokens, depending on which form of authentication the application
has chosen to use.

#### Parameters

*   `params` **[Object][7]** 

    *   `params.error` **[api.BasicError][30]** The Basic error object.

## connection

The 'connection' namespace is used to connect and maintain connections between
the SDK and one or more backend servers.

### getSocketState

Get the state of the websocket.

Returns **[connection.WSConnectionObject][68]** Details about the current websocket connection, including state and configuration.

### enableConnectivityChecking

Enables or disables connectivity checking.

This API will change the `connectivity.checkConnectivity` configuration set during SDK initialization. If there
was a connected websocket while it is changed, the change will take affect immediately.

#### Parameters

*   `enable` **[boolean][11]** Whether the websocket should be pinging to check for connectivity issues or not.

### resetConnection

Resets the connected websocket by manually disconnecting then reconnecting.

This API will simulate the SDK receiving a websocket disconnect from the browser,
which will trigger its recovery functionality. This API can be used if the application
is aware of a network issue before the SDK is notified by the browser.

If there is no websocket connected, this API has no effect. If the SDK is not configured
to autoreconnect (see `connectivity.autoReconnect` configuration property), then this
API will not attempt to reconnect the websocket automatically.

The normal websocket and lifecycle events will be emitted during this operation,
notably the [ws:change][69] event.

### WSConnectionObject

Information about a websocket connection.

Can be retrieved using the [connection.getSocketState][70] API.

Type: [Object][7]

#### Properties

*   `connected` **[boolean][11]** The state of the websocket connection.
*   `pinging` **[boolean][11]** True if the client has sent a ping to the server and is still waiting for a pong response.
*   `pingInterval` **[number][13]** How often the client will ping the server to test for websocket connectivity.
*   `reconnectLimit` **[number][13]** How many times the SDK will try to reconnect a disconnected websocket.
*   `reconnectDelay` **[number][13]** How long the SDK will wait before retrying websocket reconnection.
*   `reconnectTimeMultiplier` **[number][13]** Reconnect delay multiplier for subsequent attempts. The reconnect delay time will be multiplied by this after each failed reconnect attempt to increase the delay between attempts. eg. 5000ms then 10000ms then 20000ms delay if value is 2.
*   `reconnectTimeLimit` **[number][13]** Maximum time delay between reconnect attempts (milliseconds). Used in conjunction with `reconnectTimeMultiplier` to prevent overly long delays between reconnection attempts.
*   `autoReconnect` **[boolean][11]** Indicates if the SDK should automatically try reconnecting a disconnected websocket.
*   `webSocketOAuthMode` **[string][8]** The mode used for authenticating with the server.
*   `wsInfo` **[Object][7]** Information required to connect a websocket to the server.

    *   `wsInfo.protocol` **[string][8]?** The protocol to use to connect a websocket.
    *   `wsInfo.server` **[string][8]?** The domain name or IP address of the server to connect to.
    *   `wsInfo.port` **[number][13]?** The port of the server to connect to.
    *   `wsInfo.url` **[string][8]?** The URL path to use to request a websocket connection.
    *   `wsInfo.params` **[string][8]?** Any additional params that might be required by the server to establish the websocket connection.

### ws:change

The WebSocket to the server has changed state.

This event is only emitted when the WebSocket is connected, or has lost connection.

## logger

The SDK has an internal logging system for providing information about its
behaviour. The SDK will generate logs, at different levels for different
types of information, which are routed to a
"[Log Handler][4]" for consumption. An application
can provide their own Log Handler (see
[config.logs][71]) to customize how the logs are
handled, or allow the default Log Handler to print the logs to the
console.

The SDK's default Log Handler is merely a thin wrapper around the browser's
console API (ie. `window.console`). It receives the log generated by the
SDK, called a "[Log Entry][5]", formats a
human-readable message with it, then uses the console to log it at the
appropriate level. This is important to be aware of, since your browser's
console may affect how you see the SDK's default log messages. Since the
default Log Handler uses the console's levels, the browser may filter
which messages are shown depending on which levels it has configured. For
a user that understands console log levels, this can be helpful for
filtering the logs to only the relevant information. But it can equally
be a hindrance by hiding the more detailed log messages (at the 'debug'
level), since browser can have this level hidden by default. For this
reason, we recommend providing a custom Log Handler to the SDK that is
better suited for your application and its users.

### levels

Possible levels for the SDK logger.

The SDK will provide [Log Entries][5] to the
[Log Handler][4] for all logs at or above the set
log level. 'debug' is considered the lowest level and 'silent' the
highest level. For example, if the current level is 'info', then the
[Log Handler][4] will receive
[Log Entries][5] for logs at 'info', 'warn', and
'error', but not for the 'debug' level.

#### Properties

*   `SILENT` **[string][8]** Nothing will be logged.
*   `ERROR` **[string][8]** Unhandled error information will be logged. If
    the SDK encounters an issue it cannot resolve, the error will be included
    in the logs. This likely points to an issue with the SDK itself or an
    issue with how the SDK is being used.
*   `WARN` **[string][8]** Warning messages for the application developer will
    be logged. If the SDK encounters an issue that it can recover and continue,
    a warning about the issue will be included in the logs. These logs point
    to issues that need to be handled by the application. For example, providing
    an invalid configuration to the SDK will cause a warning log that explains
    the issue.
*   `INFO` **[string][8]** General information about the SDK's operations will
    be logged, outlining how the SDK is handling the operations. Reading through
    these logs should provide a high-level view of what the SDK is doing,
    and why it is doing it.
*   `DEBUG` **[string][8]** Detailed information about the SDK's operations,
    meant for debugging issues, will be logged. Specific information and relevant
    operation data are provided for understanding the scenario that the SDK
    was in during the operation.

### LogEntry

A LogEntry object is the data that the SDK compiles when information is
logged. It contains both the logged information and meta-info about when
and who logged it.

A [LogHandler][4] provided to the SDK (see
[config.logs][71]) will need to handle LogEntry
objects.

Type: [Object][7]

#### Properties

*   `timestamp` **[number][13]** When the log was created, based on UNIX epoch.
*   `method` **[string][8]** The log function that was used to create the log.
*   `level` **[string][8]** The level of severity the log.
*   `target` **[Object][7]** The subject that the log is about.

    *   `target.type` **[string][8]** The type of the target. This is also
        used as part of the name of the Logger.
    *   `target.id` **[string][8]?** A unique identifier for the target.
    *   `target.name` **[string][8]** A combination of the target type and ID. If no
        id was provided, this will be the same as the type.
*   `messages` **[Array][19]** The logged information, given to the Logger
    method as parameters.
*   `timer` **[Object][7]?** Timing data, if the log method was a timer method.

#### Examples

```javascript
function defaultLogHandler (logEntry) {
  // Compile the meta info of the log for a prefix.
  const { timestamp, level, target } = logEntry
  let { method } = logEntry
  const logInfo = `${timestamp} - ${target.type} - ${level}`

  // Assume that the first message parameter is a string.
  const [log, ...extra] = logEntry.messages

  // For the timer methods, don't actually use the console methods.
  //    The Logger already did the timing, so simply log out the info.
  if (['time', 'timeLog', 'timeEnd'].includes(method)) {
    method = 'debug'
  }

  console[method](`${logInfo} - ${log}`, ...extra)
}
```

### LogHandler

A LogHandler can be used to customize how the SDK should log information. By
default, the SDK will log information to the console, but a LogHandler can
be configured to change this behaviour.

A LogHandler can be provided to the SDK as part of its configuration (see
[config.logs][71]). The SDK will then provide this
function with the logged information.

Type: [Function][15]

#### Parameters

*   `LogEntry` **[Object][7]** The LogEntry to be logged.

#### Examples

```javascript
// Define a custom function to handle logs.
function logHandler (logEntry) {
  // Compile the meta info of the log for a prefix.
  const { timestamp, level, target } = logEntry
  let { method } = logEntry
  const logInfo = `${timestamp} - ${target.type} - ${level}`

  // Assume that the first message parameter is a string.
  const [log, ...extra] = logEntry.messages

  // For the timer methods, don't actually use the console methods.
  //    The Logger already did the timing, so simply log out the info.
  if (['time', 'timeLog', 'timeEnd'].includes(method)) {
    method = 'debug'
  }

  console[method](`${logInfo} - ${log}`, ...extra)
}

// Provide the LogHandler as part of the SDK configurations.
const configs = { ... }
configs.logs.handler = logHandler
const client = create(configs)
```

## makeAnonymous

Starts an outgoing call as an anonymous user.

The call will be tracked by a unique ID that is returned by the API. The
application will use this ID to identify and control the call after it
has been initiated.

The [call.getById][26] API can be used to retrieve
the current information about the call.

The progress of the operation will be tracked via the
[call:operation][20] event.

The SDK will emit a [call:start][72] event
locally when the operation completes. When the remote participant
receives the call, a [call:receive][73]
event will be emitted remotely for them.

The SDK requires access to the machine's media devices (eg. microphone)
in order to make a call. If it does not already have permissions to
use the devices, the user may be prompted by the browser to give
permissions.

Detached media can be used when starting a call. Detached media is created
locally outside of a call and must be managed by the application. It can
be used when making a call by passing an array of detached track ids in
the media object. You can start a call with a mixture of detached
and requested media, however, you can only use one of each type (audio, video,
screen). For example, you could include a detached track id for video, and set
MediaConstraint.audio: true, but you can't set MediaConstraint.video: true
if you have passed in a detached track id of kind video.

### Parameters

     fromToken: createToken('sip:' + account, key),
     toToken: createToken('sip:' + callee, key),
     realm: 'realmAbc123...'
};

let callId = client.call.makeAnonymous(callee, credentials, callOptions);
```

Returns **[string][8]** Id of the outgoing call.

## media

The 'media' namespace provides an interface for interacting with Media that the
SDK has access to. Media is used in conjunction with the [Calls][75]
feature to manipulate and render the Tracks sent and received from a Call.

Media and Track objects are not created directly, but are created as part of
Call operations. Media and Tracks will either be marked as "local" or
"remote" depending on whether their source is the local user's machine
or a remote user's machine.

The Media feature also keeps track of media devices that the user's machine
can access. Any media device (eg. USB headset) connected to the machine
can be used as a source for media. Available devices can be found using
the [media.getDevices][76] API.

### getDevices

Retrieves the available media devices for use.

The [devices:change][77] event will be
emitted when the available media devices have changed.

### initializeDevices

Requests permission to access media devices on the end-user's machine.

This API will trigger the browser to ask the end-user for permission to
access their camera and/or microphone. These permissions are
needed for the SDK to read information about the devices (the label,
for example) and for using the devices for a call.

If the browser does not yet have permission, it will prompt the end-user
with a small pop-up window, giving the user a chance to allow/deny the
permissions. The behaviour of this pop-up window differs slightly
based on the browser; it may automatically save the user's decision
(such as in Chrome and Safari) or it may require the user to choose
whether their decision should be saved (such as in Firefox).

This API is not required for proper usage of media and/or calls, but
helps to prepare a user before a call is made or received. It allows
an application to prompt the user for device permissions when it is
convenient for them, rather than during call setup. If the user saves
their decision, they will not be prompted again when the SDK accesses
those devices for a call.

For device information, the [media.getDevices][76] API will retrieve
the list of media devices available for the SDK to use. If this list
is empty, or is missing information, it is likely that the browser
does not have permission to access the device's information. We
recommend using the [media.initializeDevices][78] API in this
scenario if you would like to allow the end-user to select which
device(s) they would like to use when they make a call, rather than
using the system default.

The SDK will emit a [devices:change][77]
event when the operation is successful or a
[devices:error][79] event if an error is
encountered.

#### Parameters

*   `constraints` **[Object][7]?** 

    *   `constraints.audio` **[boolean][11]** Whether to ask for audio device permissions. (optional, default `true`)
    *   `constraints.video` **[boolean][11]** Whether to ask for video device permissions. (optional, default `true`)

#### Examples

```javascript
// The SDK will ask for both audio and video permissions by default.
client.media.initializeDevices()

// The SDK will only ask for audio permissions.
client.media.initializeDevices({ audio: true, video: false })
```

### renderTracks

Render Media Tracks in a container.

The container is specified by providing a CSS selector string that
corresponds to the HTMLElement to act as the container.

#### Parameters

*   `trackIds` **[Array][19]<[string][8]>** List of Track IDs to be rendered.
*   `cssSelector` **[string][8]** A CSS selector string that uniquely
    identifies an element. Ensure that special characters are properly
    escaped.
*   `options` **[Object][7]?** Additional options for rendering the tracks.

    *   `options.speakerId` **[string][8]?** The speaker's Device ID to use for audio tracks.

#### Examples

```javascript
// When a Call receives a new track, render it.
client.on('call:tracksAdded', function (params) {
   params.trackIds.forEach(trackId => {
     const track = client.media.getTrackById(trackId)
     const container = track.isLocal ? localContainer : remoteContainer

     // Render the Call's new track when it first becomes available.
     client.media.renderTracks([ trackId ], container)
   }
})
```

### muteTracks

Mutes the specified Tracks.

This API prevents the media of the specified Tracks from being rendered. Audio
Tracks will become silent and video Tracks will be a black frame.
This does not stop media from being received by those Tracks. The media simply
cannot be used by the application while the Track is muted.

If a local Track being sent in a Call is muted, the Track will be
noticeably muted for the remote user. If a remote Track received in a
call is muted, the result will only be noticeable locally.

This mute operation acts on those specified Tracks directly.
It does not act on the active Call as a whole.

The SDK will emit a [media:muted][80] event
when a Track has been muted.

#### Parameters

*   `trackIds` **[Array][19]<[string][8]>** List of Track IDs.

### unmuteTracks

Unmutes the specified Tracks.

Media will resume its normal rendering for the Tracks.
Like the 'muteTracks' API, this unmute operation acts on those specified Tracks directly.
Therefore it does not act on active Call as a whole.

The SDK will emit a [media:unmuted][81] event
when a Track has been unmuted.

#### Parameters

*   `trackIds` **[Array][19]<[string][8]>** List of Track IDs.

### removeTracks

Remove Media Tracks from a container.

The container is specified by providing a CSS selector string that
corresponds to the HTMLElement to act as the container.

#### Parameters

*   `trackIds` **[Array][19]<[string][8]>** List of Track IDs to stop being rendered.
*   `cssSelector` **[string][8]** A CSS selector string that uniquely
    identifies an element. Ensure that special characters are properly
    escaped.

### DetachedMedia

Detached Media is a special type of [call.MediaObject][82] that is created outside the scope of a call. A DetachedMedia
object is a [call.MediaObject][82] that is wrapped with the contained [call.TrackObject][83]'s media type for convenience.

The APIs for managing detached media are available in the [media][84] namespace. They are
[media.createLocalMedia][85], [media.getLocalMedia][86], and [media.disposeLocalMedia][87]. Unlike media that is created
as part of a call, the application is responsible for the lifecycle for a detached media object.

Accessing local media before a call is made can be used to implement a "media preview" feature, allowing an end-user to
check their media devices before joining a call.

Detached Media can also be used as part of a call, rather than new media being created as part of the call operations. This can be
done as an optimization, to avoid the overhead of creating new media objects during the call setup process. The same Detached
Media objects can be used for multiple calls, as well.

Type: [Object][7]

#### Properties

*   `media` **call.MediaObject** The media object.
*   `type` **[string][8]** The type of the media object ('audio', 'video', or 'screen').

#### Examples

```javascript
// Create new detached media objects.
const medias = await client.media.createLocalMedia({ audio: true, video: true })
// medias === [ { type: 'audio', media: <call.MediaObject> }, { type: 'video', media: <call.MediaObject> } ]
// where medias[x].type === client.media.getTrackById(medias[x].media.tracks[0].id).type)

// Render the local video as a preview.
client.media.renderTracks([ medias[1].media.tracks[0].id ], '#localVideoPreview')

// Use the Detached Media in a call, instead of creating new media for it.
const call = client.call.make('destination', { audio: false, video: false, medias: medias })
```

### devices:change

The media devices available for use have changed.

Information about the available media devices can be retrieved using the
[media.getDevices][76] API.

#### Examples

```javascript
// Listen for changes to available media devices.
client.on('devices:change', function () {
   // Retrieve the latest media device lists.
   const devices = client.media.getDevices()
})
```

### devices:error

An error occurred while trying to access media devices.

The most common causes of this error are when the browser does not have
permission from the end-user to access the devices, or when the browser
cannot find a media device that fulfills the
[MediaConstraint(s)][88] that was provided.

#### Parameters

*   `params` **[Object][7]** 

    *   `params.error` **[Error][89]** The Basic error object.

### media:muted

The specified Tracks have been muted.

A Track can be muted using the [media.muteTracks][55] API.

#### Parameters

*   `params` **[Object][7]** 

    *   `params.tracks` **[Array][19]<[string][8]>** The list of Tracks that were muted.

### media:unmuted

The specified Tracks have been unmuted.

A Track can be unmuted using the [media.unmuteTracks][90]
API.

#### Parameters

*   `params` **[Object][7]** 

    *   `params.tracks` **[Array][19]<[string][8]>** The list of Tracks that were unmuted.

### media:sourceMuted

The specified Track has had its media source muted.

The Track is still active, but is not receiving media any longer. An audio
track will be silent and a video track will be a black frame. It is
possible for the track to start receiving media again (see the
[media:sourceUnmuted][91] event).

This event is generated outside the control of the SDK. This will predominantly
happen for a remote track during network issues, where media will lose frames
and be "choppy". This may also happen for a local track if the browser or
end-user stops allowing the SDK to access the media device, for example.

#### Parameters

*   `params` **[Object][7]** 

    *   `params.trackId` **[string][8]** The track that is affected as a result of media source being muted.

### media:sourceUnmuted

The specified Track has started receiving media from its source once again.

The Track returns to the state before it was muted (see the
[media:sourceMuted][92] event), and will
be able to display video or play audio once again.

This event is generated outside the control of the SDK, when the cause of the
media source being muted had been undone.

#### Parameters

*   `params` **[Object][7]** 

    *   `params.trackId` **[string][8]** The track that is affected as a result of media source being unmuted.

### media:trackRendered

The specified Track has been rendered into an element.

#### Parameters

*   `params` **[Object][7]** 

    *   `params.trackIds` **[Array][19]<[string][8]>** The list of track id's that were rendered.
    *   `params.selector` **[string][8]** The css selector used to identify the element the track is rendered into.
    *   `params.error` **[api.BasicError][30]?** An error object, if the operation was not successful.

### media:trackEnded

A local Track has ended unexpectedly. The Track may still be part of a Call but
has become disconnected from its media source and is not recoverable.

This event is emitted when an action other than an SDK operation stops the
track. The most comon scenarios are when a device being used for a Call
disconnects, any local tracks (such as audio from a bluetooth headset's
microphone or video from a USB camera) from that device will be ended.
Another scenario is for screensharing, where some browsers provide the
ability to stop screensharing directly rather than through an SDK operation.

When a local track ends this way, it will still be part of the Call but will
not have any media. The track can be removed from the call with the
[call.removeMedia][42] API so the remote side of the Call knows the track
has stopped, or the track can be replaced with a new track using the
[call.replaceTrack][36] API to prevent any interruption.

#### Parameters

*   `params` **[Object][7]** 

    *   `params.trackId` **[Object][7]** The Track that has ended.
    *   `params.callId` **[Object][7]** The ID of the Call the Track is used in.

## notification

The 'notification' namespace allows user to register/deregister for/from push notifications as well as
enabling/disabling the processing of websocket notifications.

### process

Provides an external notification to the system for processing.

#### Parameters

*   `notification` **[Object][7]** The notification object from which to extract relevant data.
*   `channel` **[string][8]** The channel that the notification came from.
    If no channel provided, then by default it will be a PUSH notification. (optional, default `'PUSH'`)

Returns **[undefined][64]** 

### notifications:change

Push notifications registration state has changed.

#### Parameters

*   `params` **[Object][7]** 

    *   `params.channel` **[string][8]** The channel for the notification.

### notifications:error

An error occurred with push notifications.

#### Parameters

*   `params` **[Object][7]** 

    *   `params.error` **[api.BasicError][30]** The Basic error object.
    *   `params.channel` **[string][8]** The channel for the notification.

## request

The 'request' namespace (within the 'api' type) is used to make network requests to the server.

### fetch

Send a request to the underlying REST service with the appropriate configuration and authentication.
This is a wrapper on top of the browser's [fetch API][93]
and behaves very similarly but using SDK configuration for the base URL and authentication as well
as SDK logging.

#### Parameters

*   `resource` **[string][8]** The full path of the resource to fetch from the underlying service. This should include any REST version
    or user information. This path will be appended to the base URL according to SDK configuration.
*   `init` **RequestInit** An object containing any custom settings that you want to apply to the request. See [fetch API][93]
    for a full description and defaults.

#### Examples

```javascript
// Send a REST request to the server
// Create a request options object following [fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch)
const requestOptions = {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    test: 123
  })
}

// Note that you will need to subscribe for the `custom` service in order to
// receive notifications from the `externalnotification` service.
const response = await client.request.fetch('/rest/version/1/user/xyz@test.com/externalnotification', requestOptions)
```

Returns **[Promise][46]<[Response][94]>** A promise for a [Response][95] object.

## sdpHandlers

A set of [SdpHandlerFunction][65]s for manipulating SDP information.
These handlers are used to customize low-level call behaviour for very specific
environments and/or scenarios.

Note that SDP handlers are exposed on the entry point of the SDK. They can be added during
initialization of the SDK using the [config.call.sdpHandlers][96] configuration
parameter. They can also be set after the SDK's creation by using the
[call.setSdpHandlers][97] function.

### Examples

```javascript
import { create, sdpHandlers } from '@rbbn/webrtc-js-sdk';
const codecRemover = sdpHandlers.createCodecRemover(['VP8', 'VP9'])
const client = create({
  call: {
    sdpHandlers: [ codecRemover, <Your-SDP-Handler-Function>, ...]
  }
})
```

```javascript
// Through the Call API post-instantiation
client.call.setSdpHandlers([ codecRemover, <Your-SDP-Handler-Function>, ...])
```

### CodecSelector

An object that represents a selector to match codecs of an RTP map in SDP.

Type: [Object][7]

#### Properties

*   `name` **[string][8]** The name of the codec.
*   `fmtpParams` **[Array][19]<[string][8]>** An array of strings to match against the "a=fmtp" format parameters for the corresponding codec.
    All of the elements in the array must be contained in the "a=fmtp" attribute in order to be a match.

### createCodecRemover

This function creates an SDP handler that will remove codecs matching the selectors specified for SDP offers and answers.

In some scenarios it's necessary to remove certain codecs being offered by the SDK to remote parties. For example, some legacy call services limit the SDP
length (usually to 4KB) and will reject calls that have SDP size above this amount.

While creating an SDP handler would allow a user to perform this type of manipulation, it is a non-trivial task that requires in-depth knowledge of WebRTC SDP.

To facilitate this common task, the createCodecRemover function creates a codec removal handler that can be used for this purpose. Applications can use this codec
removal handler in combination with the [call.getAvailableCodecs][25] function in order to build logic to determine the best codecs to use
for their application.

#### Parameters

*   `codecs` **([Array][19]\<CodecSelector> | [Array][19]<[string][8]>)** A list of codec selectors to remove from the SDP. If passing a list of strings, they will be converted into
    codec selectors that correspond to those names without any extra FMTP parameters.

#### Examples

```javascript
import { create, sdpHandlers } from '@rbbn/webrtc-js-sdk';

const codecRemover = sdpHandlers.createCodecRemover([
  // Remove all VP8 and VP9 codecs.
  'VP8',
  'VP9',

  // Remove all H264 codecs with the specified FMTP parameters.
  {
    name: 'H264',
    fmtpParams: ['packetization-mode=0']
  }
])

const client = create({
  call: {
    sdpHandlers: [codecRemover]
  }
})
```

Returns **call.SdpHandlerFunction** The resulting SDP handler that will remove the codec.
